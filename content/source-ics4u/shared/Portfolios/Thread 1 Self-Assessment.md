The end of the module is approaching, and your final task is to complete your self-assessment and propose a numeric grade, based on the evidence you have placed in your portfolio over the last three weeks.

## Create your entry

Go to Notion, click the small arrow at right beside the blue **New** button, then select the **End-of-thread Self-Assessment** option.

Rename the entry to **Thread 1 Self-Assessment**, then fill in the template provided.

Here is [an example of what a completed self-assessment](https://lakefieldcs.notion.site/Thread-1-Self-Assessment-110d4a49de518088a75fe2e73b14fd98) might look like.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The example above is for a student in the Grade 10 Digital Tech course, but the example of how to fill in a self-assessment is still a good one.
