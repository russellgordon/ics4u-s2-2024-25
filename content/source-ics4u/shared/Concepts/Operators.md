## Arithmetic Operators

Swift supports the standard arithmetic operators found in most programming languages:

- `+`Â (Addition): Adds two values together.  
    Example:Â `2 + 3 // Result: 5`
- `-`Â (Subtraction): Subtracts one value from another.  
    Example:Â `5 - 2 // Result: 3`
- `*`Â (Multiplication): Multiplies two values.  
    Example:Â `4 * 3 // Result: 12`
- `/`Â (Division): Divides one value by another.  
    Example:Â `10 / 2 // Result: 5`
- `%`Â (Remainder): Returns the remainder of division, when using integers.  
    Example:Â `9 % 4 // Result: 1`

On a related note, in Swift, theÂ `remainder(dividingBy:)`Â method for theÂ `Double`Â data type computes the remainder when a value is divided by anotherÂ `Double`. This method returns the remainder of the division, keeping the sign of the original value.

Here is the basic syntax:

```swift
let remainder = someDouble.remainder(dividingBy: anotherDouble)
```

Here is a simple example:

```swift
let number = 14.0
let divisor = 2.5
let result = number.remainder(dividingBy: divisor)
print("Remainder: \(result)")  // Output: Remainder: 1.5
```

In this example,Â `14.0`Â divided byÂ `2.5`Â leaves a remainder ofÂ `1.5`.

## Assignment Operator

- `=`Â (Assignment): Assigns a value to a variable.  
    Example:Â `let a = 5`Â assigns the valueÂ `5`Â to the constantÂ `a`.

The assignment operator can be combined with arithmetic operators to update a variable's value:

- `+=`: Add and assign  
    Example:Â 
    ```swift
	var b = 3
	b += 2 // Result: b is now 5  
	```
- `-=`: Subtract and assign  
    Example:Â 
    ```swift
	var c = 8
	c -= 3 // Result: c is now 5
	```
- `*=`: Multiply and assign  
    Example:Â 
    ```swift
	var d = 4
	d *= 2 // Result: d is now 8
	```
- `/=`: Divide and assign  
    Example:
    ```swift
	var e = 10
	e /= 2 // Result: e is now 5
	```
- `%=`: Modulo and assign  
    Example:
    ```swift
	var f = 9
	f %= 4 // Result: f is now 1
	```

## Exercises

Create a new [[Xcode Playgrounds|Xcode playground]] named **Operators** to complete these exercises.

You can do these regular exercises (immediately below), or skip ahead and [[Operators#Exercises Taylor's Version|do the Taylor Swift themed exercises]]. I know what I'd pick! ðŸŽ¶

### 1: Simple Arithmetic

1. Use variables to store the valuesÂ `10`Â andÂ `3`.
2. Perform the following operations with the two variables you created, and print the results:
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Remainder

### 2: Updating Values

1. Create a variable calledÂ `score`Â and set its value toÂ `50`.
2. Use the assignment operators (`+=`,Â `-=`,Â `*=`,Â `/=`,Â `%=`) to update the value ofÂ `score`Â with different numbers. Print the results after each update.

### 3: Combining Operators

1. Create a variable calledÂ `result`Â and assign it an initial value ofÂ `100`.
2. Use a combination of arithmetic and assignment operators to perform the following tasks:
    - Subtract 20 fromÂ `result`.
    - DivideÂ `result`Â by 2.
    - MultiplyÂ `result`Â by 5.
    - Take the remainder ofÂ `result`Â divided by 7.

### 4: Calculating Total Cost

1. Imagine you're shopping. Start with a variable calledÂ `totalCost`Â set toÂ `0.0`.
2. Add the following item costs toÂ `totalCost`Â using theÂ `+=`Â operator:
    - $19.99
    - $25.50
    - $8.75
3. Print the final total.

### 5: Remainders

1. You are baking cookies and haveÂ `12.5`Â cups of flour. Each batch of cookies requires exactlyÂ `2.75`Â cups of flour. Write a program to calculate how much flour will be left over after making as many full batches of cookies as possible. Use theÂ `Double`Â type and theÂ `remainder(dividingBy:)`Â method.

## Exercises: Taylor's Version

### 1: Simple Arithmetic

_"Addition is the best thing that's ever been mine!"_

1. Taylor just finished herÂ _Eras Tour_Â and wants to tally up some numbers. She performed 10 concerts in the U.S. and 3 concerts internationally.
2. Use variables to store the valuesÂ `10`Â (U.S. concerts) andÂ `3`Â (international concerts).
3. Perform the following operations and print the results:
    - How many total concerts did Taylor perform?
    - If Taylor had to cancel 4 concerts from the total, how many would be left?
    - If each U.S. concert had 50,000 attendees, how many total attendees were there for the U.S. shows?
    - If Taylor sold 120,000 total tickets for her international shows and you divide them equally between the 3 concerts, how many tickets were sold per show?
    - If Taylor released 9 versions of herÂ _1989_Â album and numbered them, what would be the remainder if you divide the total number by 4?

### 2: Updating Values

Â _"It's a Love Story (in numbers)"_

1. Taylor has 27 original songs on herÂ _Fearless_Â (Taylor's Version) album, but sheâ€™s been writing more!
2. Create a variable calledÂ `totalSongs`Â and set its value toÂ `27`.
3. Use the assignment operators (`+=`,Â `-=`,Â `*=`,Â `/=`,Â `%=`) to update the value ofÂ `totalSongs`Â as Taylor adds or removes songs:
    - Taylor writes 10 more songs.
    - She removes 5 songs from the set list for her next concert.
    - She triples the number of songs to record different versions for different countries.
    - She decides to split the total number of songs equally across 3 albums.
    - She wonders how many songs would be left if she tried to fit the total into sets of 6.

### 3: Combining Operators

_"Shake it up!"_

1. Create a variable calledÂ `toursCompleted`Â and assign it the valueÂ `3`Â (representing Taylor's completed tours).
2. UpdateÂ `toursCompleted`Â to reflect the following:
    - Taylor announces 2 more tours next year.
    - Due to scheduling, she cancels 1 tour.
    - She multiplies her total tours by 2 as she plans to perform each one twice.
    - Taylor divides her tours equally across 4 continents.
    - She wants to know how many tours would be left over if she grouped them into sets of 3.

### 4: Ticket Sales

_"Ticketmaster, look what you made me do!"_

1. Taylor is tracking her concert ticket sales. She starts with a variable calledÂ `totalTicketsSold`Â set toÂ `0`.
2. Add the following ticket sales toÂ `totalTicketsSold`Â using theÂ `+=`Â operator:
    - 65,000 tickets sold for her show in Nashville.
    - 80,000 tickets sold for her show in Los Angeles.
    - 72,000 tickets sold for her show in New York.
3. Print the final total of tickets sold.

### 5:Â Remainders

_"The Long Concert Break"_

Taylor is planning her next world tour. She wants to perform a series ofÂ _very_Â specific 3.5-hour concerts, but she has a total of 27.8 hours available for concerts.

Write a program to calculate the remainder of hours Taylor will have after performing as many full concerts as possible using theÂ `Double`Â type and theÂ `remainder(dividingBy:)`Â method.
