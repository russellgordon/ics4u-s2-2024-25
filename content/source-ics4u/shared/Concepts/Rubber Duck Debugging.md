Solving logical errors and syntax errors can be frustrating, but everyone deals with it, even experienced programmers.

Pairing with a friend to describe what you are trying to do with your code, line by line, can be helpful.

Often during this process, you will realize the source of the problem you are having.

When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)!

They make great listeners!  ðŸ¦†
