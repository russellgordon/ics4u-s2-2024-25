A *geofenced app* is an app that responds to the user's location, as determined by GPS.

In today's class, you will load a prototype of a Scavenger Hunt app on to your phone.

The app uses location services:

The idea of this app is that the user is provided with a clue, which is in the form of a riddle, and hints at a location on the LCS campus:

Once you arrive at that location, you should find something you can see that provides you with the answer to the riddle.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Even if you know the answer to the riddle, you must move to the correct location on campus to unlock the ability to answer the riddle.
