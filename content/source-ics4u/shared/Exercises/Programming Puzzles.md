This post serves to provide convenient links to reviews of programming concepts such as:

- [[Operators]]
- [[Concepts/Loops|Loops]]
- [[Selection Statements]]

> [!TIP]

> The above links are new concept summaries, each with a few practice exercises.

> Mr. Gordon used a couple of different large language models to generate these, then proof-read them and corrected a variety of errors. 

You can hone your programming skills, using these concepts, by trying the following puzzles.

## Puzzles

For each puzzle below, write both a command-line program with logic that solves the problem, and automated unit tests. You may use the [[Functions#Create a function|getInput function]] to collect user input.

1. [[Friendly Numbers]]

*At least one more puzzle to come...*

> If at all possible, do **not** try these puzzles alone. Work with a friend from class. Try some examples out on a whiteboard or a sheet of paper. Then describe in point-form English what steps you need to take to solve the program in code. Try to apply the concept of [[Functional Decomposition|functional decomposition]] to break the larger problem up into smaller parts – using functions also makes your code testable.

Here is an example of Mr. Gordon following the process described above to solve the ISBN Numbers puzzle – note that this video has chapters to allow you to hone in on the part of the problem solving process you are most interested in:
