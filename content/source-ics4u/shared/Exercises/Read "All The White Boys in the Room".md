Mr. Gordon has provided you with an excerpt from the book [Ruined by Design](https://www.ruinedby.design).

This is a chapter from the book, titled "All the White Boys in the Room".

While you are in class today, read, highlight, and take notes regarding these prompts:

1. What are some specific ways that innovations (computing or otherwise) have led to harm due to bias in design input?
2. What are some specific actions that can be, and have been taken, to correct for bias in design?
3. What is at least one effect of an innovation you read about that could be viewed as beneficial by one individual, but harmful by another?

 To conclude today's class, we will be engaging in a conversation to discuss this reading.
