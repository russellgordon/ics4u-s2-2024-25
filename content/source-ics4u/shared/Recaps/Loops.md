As a reminder, we can use [for loops](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/beginners/how-to-use-a-for-loop-to-repeat-work) to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times.

When we need to repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains true, that's a job for a [while loop](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/beginners/how-to-use-a-while-loop-to-repeat-work).

[Operators](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/0/4/operators) allow us to assign values to a variable or a constant, perform arithmetic, or make comparisons.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Remember that with integers, the `/` operator provides the quotient of a division operation, and the `%` operator provides the remainder of a division operation.
> 
> For example, the expression `14 / 3` provides `4` and the expression `14 % 3` provides `2`, since three goes into fourteen four times, leaving a remainder of two.

[Conditional statements](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/0/8/conditional-statements) allow us to *selectively* run blocks of code when given a condition is `true`. If needed, we can [check multiple conditions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/beginners/how-to-check-multiple-conditions).

If we need to check many conditions and run different code for each condition, a [switch statement](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/beginners/how-to-use-switch-statements-to-check-multiple-conditions) might be easier to use.

## Exercise

### RSA Numbers

Try the [[rsa-numbers.pdf|following puzzle involving identifying RSA numbers]]. 

Note that after collecting input for this puzzle, in the processing section, the solution involves combining both loops and conditionals.

Please work with a partner using the *driver-navigator* pattern to complete this exercise.

Begin by making a new macOS command line project named **RSANumbers**:
