Xcode is a large application that serves several purposes for software developers.

Many different types of projects can be created for different Apple platforms.

This short tutorial will show you how to create a command-line project that runs on macOS.
## Create the project

To create a playground, make sure that Xcode is in the foreground on your computer by clicking it's icon in the Dock:

From the menu bar at top left, choose **File > New > Project...**:

You will see the following window – here, choose the **macOS** tab, then **Command Line Tool**, and then **Next**:

On the next screen, give your project a descriptive name, based on what idea you are exploring – in this example, sorting algorithms – then click **Next**:

On the next screen, choose where to save your project – and whether you want to keep track of revisions using source control (usually yes):

## Begin coding

You will see the following when your project first opens:

This is the screen where you can configure how the command-line project will be compiled into an actual executable application on your computer.

Normally, no changes are required here. So, switch to the **main.swift** file using the Project Navigator at left:

You can then run your command line program using **Command-R**.

Output will appear below the code window:

> Do not be alarmed by the message:

>  `Program ended with exit code: 0`.  
> 
> That means the program ended without generating any errors.
