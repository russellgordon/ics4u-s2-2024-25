Please [visit this page to sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/signup), and you will see something like this:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Please follow the prompts given, but be sure to do two things:
> 
> 1. Create the account against your LCS email address. For example, Mr. Gordon's email address is `rgordon@lcs.on.ca`. Your should use your own email address.
> 2. Make your username using the following format â€“ here are a few examples:
>    
>    Mr. Gordon's name is **Russell Gordon**. He creates his username as **lcs-rgordon**.
>    
>    One student in Mr. Gordon's Grade 12 class is named **Sophie Haber**. She created her username as **lcs-shaber**.
>    
>    Another student in Mr. Gordon's Grade 12 class is named **AJ Cooper**. He created his username as **lcs-acooper**.
>    
>    Please create your username following this same pattern.
>    
>    This helps Mr. Gordon find your code later on.
