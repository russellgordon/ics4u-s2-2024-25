It's important that your source code for Computer Science class not be kept in a folder that is synced to a cloud service such as Google Drive or iCloud Drive.

The `git` software that we use for [[What is Source Control?|source control]] is incompatible with cloud sync services – you will run into problems later on if you try to create a `git` repository in a folder that is being synced by other software to another "cloud" location.

Please follow this short video – it will help you set up a new folder for your Computer Science files, and a shortcut so that you can access these files quickly – keeping your files out of sync services like iCloud Drive and Google Drive:

> The video shows creation of a folder named **Grade 11 Computer Science**, as Mr. Gordon originally created this video for students in that course. Please create a folder named **Grade 12 Computer Science** on your computer.
