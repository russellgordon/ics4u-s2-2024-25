## Agenda
1. Exercise: [[Logic and Unit Tests]]

## Things to do before our next class

- [ ] Get ready for Friday's "mostly solo in-class activity" â€“ it will have the same conditions as today's exercise (but without the final comparison of solutions with your peers).
	- Prepare by:
		1. ensuring you fully understand solutions to the puzzles we have already tried together in class
		2. understand how to author a testing target with multiple unit tests
